# Movie_Portfolio_Project
Analyzing three decades of movie data.
## Context
Is the movie industry thriving or facing challenges? Has Netflix emerged as the dominant force in entertainment? These questions sparked my interest and led me to create a dataset analyzing movie revenues over the years. In this project, I specifically focused on visualizing the correlation between a movie's gross earnings and its budget. Additionally, I used scatter plots to further explore the relationship between these two key variables. But the analysis doesn't stop there; by considering other factors such as actors, genres, and user ratings, anyone (like you) can dive deeper into the film industry and uncover valuable insights.
## Content
There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, 1986-2016). Each movie has the following attributes:
budget: the budget of a movie. Some movies don't have this, so it appears as 0

company: the production company

country: country of origin

director: the director

genre: main genre of the movie.

gross: revenue of the movie

name: name of the movie

rating: rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)
